Distribution of Recipe Ratings
The distribution of recipe ratings shows a strong positive skew, with the vast majority of
recipes receiving ratings between 4 and 5 stars. This suggests that users tend to rate recipes quite favorably, 
with over 70% of recipes receiving ratings of 4.5 stars or higher.

Relationship Between Cooking Time and Ratings
Looking at the relationship between recipe preparation time and average ratings, we can observe an interesting
pattern where there is significant variation, recipes with shorter cooking times, or under an hour, tend to receive
slightly higher ratings on average. This could suggest that users prefer recipes that are more time-efficient, though 
the relationship is not very strong.

The correlation matrix reveals weak to moderate relationships between our numeric variables. 
Notably, there's a positive correlation between cooking time and number of steps (0.4), suggesting that 
more complex recipes tend to take longer to prepare. However, neither variable shows a strong correlation with 
ratings, indicating that recipe complexity and duration aren't major factors in determining user satisfaction.


# The prediction problem is to determine whether a recipe will be highly rated based on its characteristics so we 
are tackling a binary classification problem in which we can classify the variable as 1 or 0. 1 represents highly 
rated and 0 not highly rated. The response variable is Highly Rated, based on if the recipe has a higher rating than 4.5.
The threshold of 4.5 was chosen by us because we know that recipes with higher ratings are generally more appealing. 
The primary evaluation metric that we will be using is the F1-score, which balances precision and recall. 
This metric is the best for this because it minimizes false negatives and positives helping us identify highly rated recipes. 
In addition to nutritional data like calories, total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and carbs, the 
features include minutes, n_steps, and n_ingredients. In order to ensure that the model is trained on data that would 
actually be available at prediction time, these features are justified because they are all known before a recipe is 
assessed by consumers. The model uses only features that are available prior to prediction, such as preparation details 
and nutritional values, which are all just properties of the recipe. Nothing after the fact is used. This ensures the model
adheres to realistic constraints and avoids data leakage.
